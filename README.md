# EbrettiPOS
 An example of the libGDXbrowser in the shape an Ebretti Spare Part POS mock up

I made this browser to spice an assignment up. It is at a functional alpha stage.

To run the example with content, you need to change line 25 in the EbrettiPOS.java file: the String-attribute at line 25 defines the location of the partsCSV.txt file.
The CSV file is in the core/assets-folder in the project:
- The browser runs fine without the content, but it is a boring experience.

Project is built in IntelliJ and I have no idea if it will run in another IDE.

To import a libGDX project into IntelliJ, import whole project folder.
And to setup a run configuration, this video gives a clear example at linked time (~1 minute long):
