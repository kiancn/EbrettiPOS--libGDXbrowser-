# libGDXbrowser - Generation Grind
A work in progress on a content-display system. Maybe it will go places.

This 'development project' carries a baseline demo, that will display if you run the project as is. (The other branch has a bigger example; a spare parts catalogue.)

Made to spice a recent assignment up, but I like enough to keep.I made this browser to spice an assignment up. It is in a functional alpha stage.



If you never looked at a libGDX application before, my advice is to start with: 
<p>BlueContent and PreparedMenus - these are the actual <i>content</i> being displayed.</p>
<p>[path on your drive]\desktop\src\kcn\libGDXbrowser\EbrettiPOS\desktop\DesktopLauncher.java
	then look at the BrowserBase
<p>...And if you want the full tour, go into the heirarchy like: ApplicationAdaptor, Browser, menu package, content package; going to specific menus, content and buttons (or just go through stuff as you like. Everything in kcn package is written by moi ). 
	All comments welcome and almost everything is up for improvement.

Project relies on Gradle and should run out of the box - if .

To import a libGDX project into IntelliJ, import whole project folder.
And to setup a run configuration, this video gives a clear example at linked time (~1 minute long):

(The first part of the video is about creating an empty project, NOT importing it )


Any further developments on the libGDXbrowser will appear in future projects. Already underway.
