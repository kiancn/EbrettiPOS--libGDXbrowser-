# EbrettiPOS
 An example of the libGDXbrowser in the shape an Ebretti Spare Part POS mock up

I made this browser to spice an assignment up. It is at a functional alpha stage.


If you never looked at a libGDX application before, my advice is to start with: 
<p>[path on your drive]\desktop\src\kcn\libGDXbrowser\EbrettiPOS\desktop\DesktopLauncher.java
<p>... and work your way into the heirarchy (ApplicationAdaptor, and then EbrettiPOS, Browser, menu package, content package;continuing on to specific menus, content and buttons). Maybe don't read it all at once, I don't know.

Project is built in IntelliJ and I have no idea if it will run (out of the box) in another IDE.

To import a libGDX project into IntelliJ, import whole project folder.
And to setup a run configuration, this video gives a clear example at linked time (~1 minute long):

(The first part of the video is about creating an empty project, NOT importing it )


Any further developments on the libGDXbrowser will appear in future projects. Already underway.
